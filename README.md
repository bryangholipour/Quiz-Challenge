## My Story

This was an extremely tough assignment for me, but although I wasn't able to finish/ polish this app in time, I can say that I've learned more about coding from this than at any other point so far.

I chose to use my HTML to hold my questions and answers, when the more straightforward, streamlined way to go about this project would have been to use javaScript to contain that data, turn the answers into arrays, and loop through the answers to get the desired output. 

I ran into many issues in choosing to do it the HTML way, and spent many hours just trying to get the quiz to flow in the proper way. Knowing what I know now, I could have completed the objectives in 10% of the time using javaScript. The way I wrote this, I basically had to spell everything out in a very redundant way to get my app to function (different ID's for each question/ set of answers, different variables for each question/ set of answers, and different click listeners for each question/ set of answers). These could all have been combined and streamlined had I built this using JS, arrays, and for loops. I am glad I know this for next time!
